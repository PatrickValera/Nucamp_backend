Port Mapping
- 60k+ ports in a system
- http by default listens to port 80; https to port 443
- docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --rm -d --name my_jenkins jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11
    - map multiple ports

Volume (Persist Data)
- Bind mount vs volume
- use -v tag when running docker run to check or instantiate a volume
- Multiple ways to create a volume or bind mount
- docker volume ls 
- there are anonymous and named volumes

Networking
- docker network ls
- docker run --network=[network_name] [namespace]/[image_name]:[tab/version]
- docker inspect [network_name] shows containers in that network
- Each container in the network will have an ipv4 that other containers in the network can connect to

AWS
- ECR(IMAGE REGISTRY) -> ECS(CONTAINER SERVICE)
- Lambda - Faas
- (Service) Event Bridge - to schedule triggers to a Lamda or other services
- (Service) EAPI Gateway - deploy API endpoints and connect them to lamda functions or other services
- (Service) EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud - Deploy servers 
- AMI - Amazon machine Image - like a container that runs the server
