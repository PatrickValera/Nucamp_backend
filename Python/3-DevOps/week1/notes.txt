Methodologies
1.Agile vs Waterfall 
    - Agile is continous development in iterations
    - Waterfall follows a plan setup initially
2. Kanban vs Scrum
    - Both are agile methodologies when it comes to proccessing feature backlogs
    - Scrum uses sprints, usually 2 weeks
    - Kanban prioritizes one feature before another is processed

Steps to containerizing:
Add files to a dockerfile
Build an image from the dockerfile
Run image to instantiate a container

docker run --rm -d -p 8000:8000/tcp app:latest
--rm -> kill container when stopped
-d -> detached mode
-p [local port]:[container port] -> port mapping
[image name]:[tag/version] -> name and version of image to be ran
